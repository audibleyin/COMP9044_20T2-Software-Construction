# Phone Numbers Words
# Many telephones have a mapping between letters and digits on their keypad.
# the mapping is :
# "abc"->2 "def"->3 "ghi" ->4 "jkl" = 5 "mno" = 6 "pqrs" = 7 "tuv" = 8 "wxyz" = 9
# No letters map to the digits 0 and 1.  Three or four letters map to each of the other 8 digits

# Your program should print all words in the file that map to the number.
# It also should print all pairs of words that when concatenated map to that 
# number. The pair of words should be separated by single space.
